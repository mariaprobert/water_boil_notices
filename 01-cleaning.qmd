## Goals of this notebook

The steps we'll take to prepare our data:

- Download the data
- Import it into our notebook
- Clean up data types and columns
- Export the data for next notebook
- Make sure that the updated data that covers the year 2023, aligns with the rest of the data.

## Downloading Data 

Here I will download the TCEQ data that I obtained from a public records request. The data goes over the counties or jurisdictions affected by water boil notices, start and end date of a water boil notice and the nature of the water boil notice. 

More information about the data can be found on the index page of this notebook. 

Downloaded the file... 


```{r}
read_excel("data-raw/water_boil_2018_2022.xlsx")
